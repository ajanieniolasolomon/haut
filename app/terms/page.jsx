                Your satisfaction is important to us. If you are not happy with
                your products, please first call our Customer Experience Team at
                (+234) 9132496146. They would be more than happy to provide you
                with a customized routine and product recommendations based on
                your skin type and concerns. Everyone's skin is different and
                skincare is not a one-size or product suits all. There is a lot
                of trial and error when finding what works best for you.
                Whatever you choose to do, Demicare stands behind our products
                with a 30-day money-back guarantee on all products purchased
                directly from the Website. When returning products, please
                include the full name associated with the order, order and/or
                reference number, and products to be returned or exchanged (if
                any). Demicare does not provide return shipping labels; products
                will be shipped back to us at the customer’s expense.
                Return/exchange shipping costs will not be refunded. Once we
                receive the returned/exchanged package, a Customer Experience
                Representative will reach out to you within 24 - 48 hours via
                email regarding all refund and store credit procedures, subject
                to compliance with our return policy. Please note that tracking
                on returns is not always accurate as all packages are delivered
                to the Demicare mailbox. This is checked daily and delivered to
                our returns department. Returned merchandise received without
                the full name associated with the purchase, order and/or
                reference number will not be automatically refunded. If you are
                receiving a refund, please allow 3-5 business days for the funds
                to post to your account. Some refunds may take up to 10 days
